What the code does
--------
Should draw a red rectangle with a list of words, each word has a click event


Problems
--------
Missing closing React.Fragment tag
Missing super(props) call
No default props set (optional)
Lack of propTypes to help document usage
Missing key attribute on repeated item 
No real use of state, overkill as Class component

comparing to a boolean is a code smell
constructor is not needed
extract list styles into some better than css written on tag


Changes
---
add in propType for added validity
change to stateless component
add some unit tests
display a friendly empty message when list is empty (depending on how it is used)
